Identify road lanes in pictures and videos using OpenCV and Python

This repository contains:

1. A Python file that uses OpenCV to process images/videos to identify lane lines

2. A video and image file containing lane lines

After installing `Python3` and `OpenCV`, you can run the following command:

```
python3 lanes.py
```

This will open the video file and show the lane lines as the video progresses.
